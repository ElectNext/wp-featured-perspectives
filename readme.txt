Automatically add Featured Perspectives to your news posts. We showcase multiple expert perspectives for your readers, and share that premium revenue back with you.

== Description ==

We believe in a thriving press, and an informed and engaged public. So we've created a new native ad platform that delivers both:

* Relevant, engaging commentary to your readers, and
* Premium, non-CPM revenue to you.

== Installation ==

Upload to your plugin folder just like any other plugin, and activate. Then [email our WordPress partnerships director](mailto:apikey@electnext.com?subject=WordPress%20plugin%20API%20key%20request) to receive an API key which will give you access to our data. There is no fee and we do not display ads.
