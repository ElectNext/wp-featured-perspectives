A plugin for news publishers using WordPress. Our plugin automatically adds Featured Perspectives to your posts. We showcase multiple expert perspectives for readers, and share that premium revenue back with you.

== Description ==

We believe in a thriving press, and an informed and engaged public. So we've created a new native ad platform that delivers both:

* Relevant, engaging commentary to your readers, and
* Premium, non-CPM revenue to you.

== Installation ==

[Email our WordPress partnerships director](mailto:apikey@versaHQ.com?subject=WordPress%20plugin%20API%20key%20request) to establish a partnership with us, and we'll send you an API key for activating the plugin. Then upload the plugin to your plugin folder just like any other plugin, and activate it. After activation, go to the Featured Perspectives settings page to enter your API key.
